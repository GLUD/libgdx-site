			<h1>Release Builds</h1>
			<p>Release builds are versioned, e.g. 1.0.0, and are published
					periodically, usually every few months. They represent stable
					snapshots of libgdx. Note that new bug fixes and features are never
					backported to old libgdx releases.</p>

			<h1>Nightly Builds</h1>
			<p>Nightly builds are created every night, and on every change
					in the Git repository, by our build server. They contain the latest
					and greatest bug fixes and features. Nightlies are usually very
					stable, just like our master branch on Github.</p>
