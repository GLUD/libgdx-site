<p>Libgdx is being developed lovingly and not for profit by over 200 contributors across the globe. Some of them work on it
in their free-time, others can make it part of their day job. All of them contribute their code under the
very permissive Apache 2 license, which means you can use all our code in commercial and non-commercial projects
without any strings or license fees attached.
</p>

<p>Sadly, libgdx's infrastructure does not yet run on love. We currently have 2 Linodes and one Mac Mini which are
responsible for serving you the <a href="http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com">website</a>, <a href="http://www.badlogicgames.com/forum">the forum</a>, 
<a href="http://www.badlogicgames.com">the blog</a>, the <a href="downloads.html">nightly and release builds</a> and which are also
sharing the load of building nightlies on every code change via our <a href="http://libgdx.badlogicgames.com:8080">Jenkins instance</a>. All of this
costs us roughly 45$ per month.</p>

<p>The libgdx core team is kindly asking for minimal support to cover these monthly costs. Any excess donations will be used to buy development and test devices for <a href="https://github.com/orgs/libgdx/people">core contributors</a></p>
<p>You can support us on a monthly basis via Patreon, or in form of a one-time donation via Paypal</p>

<h3>Thanks for your support!</h3>
